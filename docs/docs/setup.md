## Install Instructions (Windows)

1. Install [node.js (most recent version) WITH NPM:](https://nodejs.org/en/) [MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE NPM OPTION SELECTED WHEN INSTALLING, AS SEEN [HERE](http://prntscr.com/fkwdax)]

2. Install [git here](https://git-scm.com/download/win) (when installing, just use whatever defaults it gives to you in any options)

3. Download the [Installer here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B07gEfyceilqTVJoM2JVbEg4MVk/view)

4. Put the Installer (Install_Selfbot.bat) in a folder of your choosing and run it (its a bat file so your computer is gonna scream about it being unsafe just like they do with all bat files, so don't worry)

5. Open the new Selfbot Folder, then open the src folder and and rename credentials example.json to credentials.json 

6. Add your discord token where it's indicated inside credentials.json which can be opened with any plain text editor you want (to find your discord token, use inspect element [ctrl+shift+i] on discord, then follow this [diagram here](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d3d4ad5526143204a98db268d79eadadf0d03a87/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f5569416d4f714d2e706e67)
[as a side note, it should look like "TOKEN" not ""TOKEN"", only one set of quotes]

\*WARNING DO NOT SHARE YOUR TOKEN WITH ANYBODY! People are able to use it to access your account, thats why the selfbot is able to send messages through your account, if you share this anyone can do the same to you but can do much worse things, so keep it secret!\*

Finally, Run the Run.bat inside the Selfbot folder to run the selfbot

(To update, all you need to do is run Update.bat and then restart the selfbot)
