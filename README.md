# A Discord.js Selfbot by PapaJohn#7777 forked from an old version of John#0969's selfbot

# Install Help (Windows)

1. Install node.js (most recent version) WITH NPM: https://nodejs.org/en/ [MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE NPM OPTION SELECTED WHEN INSTALLING, AS SEEN HERE http://prntscr.com/fkwdax]

2. Install git here: https://git-scm.com/download/win (when installing, just use whatever defaults it gives to you in any options)

3. Download the Installer here: http://www.mediafire.com/file/24thn21fp76ax2p/Install_Selfbot.bat

4. Put the Installer (Install Selfbot.bat) in a folder of your choosing and run it (its a bat file so your computer is gonna scream about it being unsafe just like they do with all bat files, also after this you wont need the installer anymore so you can delete it)

5. Open the new Selfbot Folder and rename credentials example.json to credentials.json and add your discord token where it's indicated (to find your discord token, use inspect element [ctrl+shift+i] on discord, then follow this here: https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d3d4ad5526143204a98db268d79eadadf0d03a87/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f5569416d4f714d2e706e67)

6. Run RunSelfBot.bat

(To update, all you need to do is run UpdateSelfbot.bat and then restart the selfbot)
